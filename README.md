# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This is a simple command-line implementation of the classic game Tic-Tac-Toe written in C++.

## Introduction

Tic-Tac-Toe is a two-player game where one player is assigned 'X' and the other 'O'. The game is played on a 3x3 grid. The players take turns placing their marks in empty squares, and the first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game. If the entire grid is filled and no player has won, the game is a draw.

## How to Play

1. **Compile the Code:** Use a C++ compiler such as g++ to compile the code.
    ```
    g++ tictactoe.cpp -o tictactoe
    ```
2. **Run the Executable:** Execute the compiled program.
    ```
    ./tictactoe
    ```
3. **Follow the Instructions:** The game will prompt you to enter your moves according to the numbered grid. Choose a cell by entering the corresponding number.
